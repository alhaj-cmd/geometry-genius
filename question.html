        <h1>What is DOM and What is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p><span>Ans:</span>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure where each node represents a part of the document. In simple terms, it is an interface between the HTML content and JavaScript code. The DOM hierarchy refers to the parent-child relationship between the nodes in the tree-like structure of the document. For example, the body element is the parent of all other elements on the page, and its child elements are the other elements contained within it.</p>

        <h1>What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p><span>Ans:</span>Event bubbling is a phenomenon in JavaScript where when an event is triggered on an element, it also triggers the same event on all its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy, up to the root element. This means that if you click on a child element, the click event will be triggered on the child, the parent, the grandparent, and so on, until it reaches the root element.</p>
