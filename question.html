            <h1>What is DOM and What is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
            <p><span>Ans:</span>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application
                programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure where each node
                represents a part of the document. In simple terms, it is an interface between the HTML content and
                JavaScript code. The DOM hierarchy refers to the parent-child relationship between the nodes in the
                tree-like structure of the document. For example, the body element is the parent of all other elements
                on the page, and its child elements are the other elements contained within it.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
            <p><span>Ans:</span> It is important to understand what the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) is. In simple
                words, it can be categorized as a programming interface for HTML as well as XML (eXtensible Markup
                Language) documents. It defines the logical structure of the documents in the form of a tree of objects
                where each HTML element is represented as a node and it also describes the way these documents can be
                manipulated as mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p> There are six different methods in which users can access or manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript:

                HTML DOM getElementById() Method
                HTML DOM getElementsByClassName() Method
                HTML DOM getElementsByName() Method
                HTML DOM getElementsByTagName() Method
                HTML DOM querySelector() Method
                HTML DOM querySelectorAll() Method</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>What is event bubble?</h1>
            <p><span>Ans:</span>Event bubbling is a phenomenon in JavaScript where when an event is triggered on an
                element, it also triggers the same event on all its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy, up to the root
                element. This means that if you click on a child element, the click event will be triggered on the
                child, the parent, the grandparent, and so on, until it reaches the root element.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>what is callback function and Why will you use it?</h1>
            <p><span>Ans:</span>A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has
                finished execution.</p>
            <p>A callback's primary purpose is to execute code in response to an event. These events might be
                user-initiated, such as mouse clicks or typing. With a callback, you may instruct your application to
                "execute this code every time the user clicks a key on the keyboard."</p>
